This is a program for Arduino designed to allow an Arduino with a ATMega16U2 chip (Arduino UNO or Arduino Mega) to be able to act as a keyboard. The program opens a new tab in chrome and goes to a rickroll gif. This requires the Arduino to have a keyboard hex flashed onto it so the computer recognizes it as a keyboard
